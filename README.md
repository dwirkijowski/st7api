# st7api
a collection of strand7 api utilities and templates

> run the init.m script from anywhere to add all files to the matlab search path

## Setup
To get the Stran7 API working you need Stran7 installed (with the license configured) and a 32-bit version of Matlab.
* **Matlab** - Newer versions of Matlab don't require any setup, but older versions (circa 2011) need a default compiler to be selected (done with `mex -setup`).

* **Strand7** - The path to the Strand7 executable need to be in your namespace. For Windows machines, copy/paste the full path into your environmental variables. The path is usually located here: `C:\Program Files (x86)\Strand7 R24\Bin`
